# DDC Nationals 2024

These writeups are solutions for the challenges I solved in the danish cybersecurity competition "De Danske Cybermesterskaber". This was specifically the national competition (final).

The CTF was held on the 4th of May 2024, and ran from about 10:00 to 21:30.

I solved x/x challenges, and got second place in the Junior bracket (15-20 year olds).
